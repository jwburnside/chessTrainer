1. e4 {Anchors a pawn in the center, opens lines for queen and bishop. Black
must fight for an equal share of the good squares} 1... e5 2. Nf3 {Develops
toward the center with threat. Exerts pressure on two key strategic squares, e5
and d4. Knights should be developed first as it is easier to determine their
optimal placement this early in the game.} 2... Nc6 {Protects the e-pawn without
a loss of time} 3. Bc4 {Seizes a valuable diagonal and puts pressure on f7. It
is not unusual this early in the game to sacrifice a piece for this pawn.} 3...
Bc5 {Similar to white's last move, it secures a diagonal and puts pressure on a
weak square.} 4. c3 {Intends to support the advance of the d-pawn in order to
have two center pawns, and bring the queen to b3 to increase pressure on f7.}
4... Qe7 {Parries the threat, as 5...exd4 6 cxd4 Qxe4+ wins a pawn.} 5. O-O d6
{Strengthens the center, supports the e-pawn and bishop, and light-square bishop
can now get into the game.} 6. d4 {Hoping that black will exchange pawns, as
6...exd4 7 cxd4 Qexd4 8 Re1 wins the black queen.} 6... Bb6 {Black need not
capture. The e-pawn is secure, so the bishop can retreat while still bearing
down from its new position.} 7. a4 {Tricky, but illogical. White is attempting
to move to a5 on the next move. If 8...Bxf5, 9 d5 strikes at the knight guarding
the bishop. After 9...Nxa5, white captures by 10 Rxa5, winning a piece. If
8...Nxa5, 9 Rxa5 Bxa5 Qa4+ nets white two pieces for a rook. White should not,
however, be attempting such combinations when his development is so backwards.}
7... a6 {Preparing a retreat for the bishop. Protecting your pieces takes
precedence over development.} 8. a5 {Hoping black will take the bait.} 8... Ba7
{Black does not bite.} 9. h3 {A useless move that weakens the position of the
pawns defending the king, which can never be remedied. The h3 pawn is now a
target, and g3 is a landing field for enemy pieces. Capturing h3 will tear open
the g-file and expose the king.} 9... Nf6 {Knight develops with a threat.} 10.
dxe5 {White forgot a pivotal rule: Always open lines that are to the advantage
of the player whose development is superior. Now blacks dark-squared bishop is
bearing down on f2} 10... Nxe5 {Stronger than taking with the pawn. The knight
is centralized and radiates power in all directions.} 11. Nxe5 {The f3 knight
was white's best defender of the castled position, and is lost on the next
move.} 11... Qxe5 {And the knight is also replaced by a powerful piece at a very
good post, and the e-pawn is threatened.} 12. Nd2 {Hoping for 12...Nxe4 13 Nxd4
Nxd4 14 Qxd4 Re1 pinning the queen. But white is not interested in grabbing
pawns, they are looking for a tactic as a reward for their patient positional
play.} 12... Bxh3 {And black takes the h-pawn to expose the g-file.} 13. gxh3
{White must capture the bishop or be down a pawn.} 13... Qg3+ {Black has exposed
the two main defects of 9 h3. He captured the h-pawn itself and utilized the g3
square, weaked by its advance, as a point of invasion.} 14. Kh1 Qxh3+ {Black
destroys another defending pawn.} 15. Kg1 Ng4 {Threatens mate by 16 Re1 Bxf2#}
16. Nf3 {Guard h2 and stop mate by the queen. If black can remove the third
kingside pawn it will remove the last bit of protection. He must either drive
off one of the defenders or attack the pawn a third time.} 16... Qg3+ 17. Kh1
Bxf2 {18 Kh1 Qh3+ 19 Nh2 Qxh2# or 18 Rxf2 Nxf2#} 0-1

1. e4 {Releases two pieces, the queen and the light squared bishop.} 1... e5 2.
Nf3 {Knight comes into play with attack, cutting out blacks choice of reply.}
2... Nc6 {Protecting the pawn and developing the Knight to its best position.}
3. Bc4 {Bishop seizes and important diagonal, and strikes at f7, black's weakest
point.} 3... Bc5 {Black countering by attacking f2, whites weak point.} 4. c3
{To support the pawn advance in the center. 5d4 will attack pawn and bishop.
Black will be forced to play 5...exd4. Recapture by 6 cxd4 will give white a
strong formation of pawns in the center. If white's plan fails, however, the b1
knight will be deprived of its most useful square.} 4... Bb6 {Threats must be
parried before continuing development. The bishop retreats in order to pre-empt
white's contemplated attack 5 d4, which attacks pawn and bishop.} 5. d4 {Hoping
to induce black to exchange pawns.} 5... Qe7 {Since black moved his bishop, he
is no longer compelled to exchange pawns. He defends the e-pawn while developing
another piece. Also sets up the possible scenario 6...exd4 7 cxd4 Qxe4+ winning
a pawn.} 6. O-O {Indirectly protects his e-pawn, if 6...exd4 7 cxd4 Qxe4 8 Re1
wins the queen.} 6... Nf6 {Develops with threat to the e-pawn.} 7. d5
{Attempting to dislodge the c6 knight from its post, but it would have been
better to develop another piece. This move: 1). Blocks the path of the c4
bishop, limiting its action 2). Increases the range of black's b6 bishop,
leading straight to whites king.} 7... Nb8 {Retreat is safer than moving the
knight to the side of the board. After 7...Na5, whites response is 8 Bd3, after
which he threatens to win the awkwardly placed knight by 9 b4.} 8. Bd3 {Defends
the e-pawn, but but Nbd2 or Qe2 would develop a piece and protect the pawn.}
8... d6 {Strengthens the center, opens a path for the c8-bishop, and relieves
the queen of the burden of defending the e-pawn.} 9. h3 {To prevent black from
pinning the knight with Bg4, but unfortunately sets the h-pawn as a convenient
target for black.} 9... h6 {While this move seems similar to white's previous,
in this case it is a gesture of attack instead of to ward off a pin. Black
intends to follow up with g5 and eventually march to g4, where white will have
to either capture or move his knight and let black capture the h3 pawn, or take
with h3. Either will open up a file on the castled king.} 10. Qe2 {A developing
move, but may be too late.} 10... g5 {A bayonet thrust to break up white's
position at g4.} 11. Nh2 {To protect g5 with the idea that he has more defenders
(3) than black has attackers (2).} 11... g4 {But black doesn't mind sacrificing
a pawn for the sake of ripping away the defensive screen around white's king.}
12. hxg4 {Practically forced, as black was threatening 12...gxh3, as well as
12...g3.} 12... Rg8 {Now black attacks the g-pawn 3 times, while white only
defends twice. White cannot bring a pawn to defend as the f-pawn is pinned.} 13.
Bxh6 {Desperately snatching a loose pawn, a risky policy considering his
lackluster development and the plight of his king. Be3 would have been better,
as it brings a piece into play and neutralizes the pressure of black's dark
squared bishop. Don't grab pawns at the expense of development or positions.}
13... Nxg4 {Gaining time by threatening the bishop. Can white save the game? If
14 Nxg4 Bxg4 15 Qc2 Bf3 (threatening Rxg2+ 17 Kh1 Qh4#) 16 g3 Qh4 and mate will
come at h1.} 14. Be3 {The bishop flees and attempts to repel one of the
assailants.} 14... Nxh2 {Black takes a piece and threatens a rook.} 15. Kxh2 {On
the alternative 15 Bxb6 axb6 16 kxh2 Qh4+ 17 Kg1 Rxg2+ 18 Kxg2 Bh3+ and white
must either walk into mate by 19 Kg1 Qg5+ 20 Kh2 Qg2# or into a discovered check
by 19 Kh2 Bxf1+ 20 Kg1 Bxe2, when the loss of material is ruinous.} 15... Qh4+
{Black has two major pieces operating with full force on the two open files near
the enemy king. The attack plays itself.} 16. Kg1 Qh3 {No defense that will
postpone mate for long. 17 g3 Rh8 18 f3 Bxe3+ 19 Qxe3 (or Rf2 Qh1#) 19 Qxg3#. Or
if 17 f3 Bxe3+ 18 Rf2 Qxg2#} *

1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 {Shuts in the dark square bishop, but white's opening
strategy is one of storing of dynamic energy, possibly by Bd3, Nbe2 and Qe2
targeting e4. Development in the Colle system is on positional lines, but the
objective is a kingside attack.} 3... e6 {Doesn't do anything to thwart white's
plans. Better would have been c5 or Bf5 which challenges white's valuable light
square bishop.} 4. Bd3 {White now controls two diagonals, while blacks light
square bishop is hemmed in by the e-pawn.} 4... c5 {Black strikes at the pawn
formation in the center and gives his queen access to the queenside. This
freeing move is of great importance in queen's pawn openings.} 5. c3 {Permits
white to meet the advance ...c4 by Bc2, keeping the bishop lined up against
black's kingside. In the event that pawns are exchanged, white can recapture
with the e-pawn and free his c1-bishop.} 5... Nc6 {Increase pressure on the
d-pawn.} 6. Nbd2 {Add pressure to the e4 square, the springboard for the coming
attack. It can hop out of the way of the queen and bishop when it is expedient
to do so.} 6... Be7 {Brings a piece into play and prepares for castling.} 7. O-O
c4 {Intent is to chase the light square bishop from a favorable post, but
instead it weakens the pressure on white's center. Tension must be maintained if
black is to have something to say about the affairs in this vital area.
Counterplay in the center is the best means of opposing a kingside attack and to
secure counterplay, the pawn position must be kept fluid.} 8. Bc2 {Retreats, but
keeps its sights set on e4.} 8... b5 {To make room for the bishop at b7, but
also to make trouble with a possible advance of his queenside pawns.} 9. e4 {The
key move in this opening. It will open up lines for attack for whites pent-up
pieces.} 9... dxe4 {Not an attractive choice for black, but required to prevent
the push to e5 where it will displace his knight.} 10. Nxe4 {Whites pieces that
were crouched in the background spring into play. White has the initiative and
commanding position with which to exercise it. If no immediate attacking
opportunities present themselves, he can do Qe2, Re1, Bf4, Bg5, and Rad1, and
wait for blacks game to crack.} 10... O-O {Might have been better to postpone
castling, as white is attacking in that direction. Better to counterplay with
10...Qc7 11...Bb7 and 12...Rd8.} 11. Qe2 {A developing move that threatens to
win a piece by 12 Nxf6+ Bxf6 13 Qe4 threatening mate wins the knight on f6.}
11... Bb7 {Guards the knight while developing another piece.} 12. Nfg5
{Threatening 13 Nxf6+ Bxf6 14 Bxf7+ Kh8 15 Qh5. Compels black to move a pawn
guarding his king, causing a permanent weakness.} 12... h6 {Had he tried
12...Nxe4, 13 Qxe4 threatens mate and compels 13...g6} 13. Nxf6+ {Removes the
best defender black's castled position.} 13... Bxf6 {The alternative of
13...gxf6 loses by 14 Nxe6 fxe6 15 Qg4+ Kh8 (15...Kf7 16 Qg6#) 16 Qg6 f5 17 Qxh6
Kg8 18 Qxe6+ and f-pawn falls next, or with 14 Nh3 (threatening 15 Bxh6)
14...Kg7 15 Bxh6+ Kxh6 16 Qe3+ Kg7 17 Qg3+ Kh8 18 Qh4+ 19 Qh7#} 14. Qe4
{Threatening mate.} 14... g6 {Better but still dangerous would have been Rc8 to
allow the king an escape. The book move saddles black with a permanent weakness.
White must now decide how to proceed with the attack. 15 Nxf7 Kxf7 (or
15...Rxf7) 16 Qxg6+ and white has two pawns for a knight with a third in sight
and blacks position broken up. But after 15 Nxf7 Rxf7 16 Qxg6+ Rg7 17 Qxh6 Nxd4,
black is suddenly the aggressor. Threatens mate in two by 18...Ne2+ 19 Kh1 Bxg2#
White must figure out a better way to break through without letting black's rook
into the game. In this case, the f-pawn is overworked, and must be lured away.}
15. Nxe6 {Attacks the queen and rook.} 15... fxe6 {Black must accept the
sacrifice or lose rook and pawn for the knight.} 16. Qxg6+ {Stronger than taking
the e-pawn, which leaves black with four ways to get out of check. Attack the
enemy with blows that leave him with fewer choices of reply.} 16... Bg7 {Only
move that doesn't walk into mate.} 17. Qh7+ {White has other choices, as in Bxh6
or Qxe6+, but this forces the king into the open where white's other pieces can
get at him.} 17... Kf7 {Only move.} 18. Bg6+ {Stronger than 18 Bxh6 where
18...Qf6 followed by 19...Rh8. The text move keeps him on the run.} 18... Kf6
{Better than Ke7, where Qxg7+ picks up a couple of bishops.} 19. Bh5 {White is
still angling for 20 Qg6+ pickup up both bishops.} 19... Ne7 {Only way to
prevent the queen check.} 20. Bxh6 {Bringing another piece into the attack. The
captured pawn is incidental.} 20... Rg8 {To parry 21 Qxg7+ Kf5 22 Qe5#. Could
have been 20...Bxh6+ Kf5 22 Rae1 where the threat of mate by either by rook or
g-pawn is decisive.} 21. h4 {New threat is 22 Bg5#} 21... Bxh6 {Loses on the
spot, but 21...e5 22 Bxg7+ Rxg7 23 dxe5+ and the rook is lost.} 22. Qf7# 1-0

1. e4 e5 {Black opens lines for his queen and dark square bishop.}
2. f4 {Offering a pawn to induce black to surrender his share of the center. Accepting will allow 3 Nf3, followed by 4 d4 to dominate the center with pawns. In addition, the opening of the f-file will offer white the opportunity to attack f7} Bc5 {Probably the safest way to decline the gambit as 1) The bishop bears down on the center and controls and excellent diagonal. 2) The bishop supplements the pawn attack on d4 and prevents white from moving his d-pawn to d4. 3) The bishop's presense at c5, overlooking g1, forbids white from castling in a hurry. }
3. Nc3 {White avoids 3 fxe5 because the reply 3...Qh4+ 4 g3 (even worse is 4 Ke2 Qxe4#) 4...Qxe4+ wins a rook for black. White's actual move is less energetic as 3 Nf3, but in playing 3 Nc3 he was trying to lure his opponent into playing 3...Bxg1 Qh4+ 5g3 Qxh2, when 6 Rg2 followed by 7 fxe5 gives white a fine game. } Nc6{A simple retort to a dubious invitation. Black continues his development by exerting pressure on e5 and d4.}
4. Nf3 {White didn't miss a chance to win material with 4 fxe5 Nxe5 5 d4? No, since 4 fxe5 is met by 4...d6, whereby Black offers a pawn for the sake of securing a free, easy development. The text-move puts an end to the possibility of being bothered by a queen check and revives the threat of winning the e-pawn.} exf4 {A poor move on at least 4 counts: 1) Black should have moved a piece to further development 2) He surrenders his hold on the center 3) He wastes time capturing a pawn he cannot retain. 4) He permists white to sieze the cetner next move, which forces a retreat by his bishop and a consequent loss of time. Black would have been better playing d6, which holds everything and frees the c8-bishop. }
5. d4 {The obvious move, it dislodges the bishop from a strong position and uncovers an attack by his own c1-bishop on the f4-pawn.} Bb4 {Would have been sounder to retreat to e7 instead, where the bishop is invaluable for defense.}
6. Bxf4 {White gains a tempo with this capture, as he recovers the lost pawn and develops a piece at the same time.} d5 Black attacks the white e-pawn, disputing possession of the center. Meanwhile, black gives his queenside pieces more ait.
7. e5 {A drawback to this move is that the occupation of e5 by a pawn deprives his pieces of a useful square, especially the knight. However, the pawn exercises a cramping effect on Black's entire position and imposes particular restraint on Black's king's knight, which cannot develop naturally at f6. }  Bxc3+ {Intending to saddle white with a doubled pawn, but why capture a piece that is pinned and can do no harm? Why relax the pressure at all? Better would be to bring up the reserves at 7...f5.}
8.bxc3 {In return for the handicap of doubled pawns (little enough, since it will undouble with the advance of c4.), white enjoys advantages in his two bishops and in the open b-file which his rook will put to good use. } Be6 {A superficial move, it would have a greater effect at f5, where it would hinder white from posting his bishop at d3, except at the cost of a bishop exchange. It is important to fight for control of the vital squares. }
9. Bd3 {The bishop reaches out in two directions here, ready to take a hand on either side of the board.} h6 {Apparently to prevent 10 Ng5 or 10 Bg5. White has no intention of making either of these moves, however, and is only interested in completing development. A move like h6 should only be played if it is to form the base for an attack by pawns. }
10. O-O {Gets the rook on a file blocked by minor pieces, but they can quickly move out of the way, unlike a pawn.} Nge7 {Not the best spot for the Knight, but the only way it can get into the game. }
11. Rb1 {Controlling an open file, even though the b-pawn is easily protected currently. Play the moves necessary to establish a superior position, and you will be rewarded. Develop your pieces to enjoy maximum mobility and control the most territory. Direct your efforts to weakening the enemy position, cramping the movement of his pieces, and reducing the capacity of his resistance before you make the first move of a combination. When the time is ripe, the attack will play itself. } b6 {No top ranking player would do this, he would refrain from disturbing the pawn formation if possible. Better alternatives would be 11...b8 or 11...Qc8. The text move weakends the light squares on blacks queenside, and deprives the c6-knight of solid support, which white will exploit from the other side of the board.  }
12. Qd2 {Leaves the first rank to enable the rooks to connect. }
O-O {Black should have asked himself how he could exploit white's one weakness, the doubles pawns on the c-file. 12...Na5 with the object of swinging the knight to c4 where it blockades the doubled pawn and interferes with the free movement of white's pieces. White could capture the knight, but then he parts with one of his valuable bishops resulting in an inferior position. Black could then anchor one of his pieces to great effect on d5, a square from which it could never be evicted by pawns. }

13. Bxh6 {At the price of a bishop, white gets two pawns and demolishes the kingside pawn barricade. }
gxh6 {Black must capture the bishop, or be a pawn down without any positional compensation. }
14. Qxh6 {White's return for sacrifice 1) Two pawns in tangible assets 2) Queen is powerfully placed in enemy territory, threatening mate on the move.  3) Queen rips away the screen of pawns that sheltered black's king. 4) Has a strong attack in prospect with 15 Ng5 5) If more help is needed, he can call up reserves (after 15 Ng5) by 16 Rf3, followed by 17 Rg3 }
Ng6 {No other defense. 14...Nf5 (to interfere with the bishop) 15 Bxf5 Bxf5 Qxc6, a consequence of black's instinctive advance of his b-pawn. Or 14...Bf5 15 Bxf5 Nxf5 16 Qxc6. Or 14...f5 leaves black's bishop en prise. }
15. Ng5 {Threatening mate at h7. Speedier than 15 Bxg6 fxg6 16 Qxg6+ 17 Qxe6 which wins material. The simplest and shortest way of winning is the best way. }  Re8 {Provides the king a flight square.}
16. Rxf7 {Again a pleasant choice of winning methods: 16 Bxg6 fxg6 17Qh7# and 16 Nh7 followed by Nf6+ and a quick mate. The move actually made nails down the king and renews the threat of mate on the move. } Bxf7 {Forced if black wants to avoid resigning.}
17. Qh7+ {Nudging the king into a fatal situation. } Kf8 {The only move.}

1.
e4 {White fixes a pawn in the center, releasing his light-square bishop and queen.}
e5 {Black responds in turn, releasing his dark-square bishop and queen. }
2.
Nf3 {White develops with threat. Against passive 2 Nc3, which attacks nothing, black can repond with 2...Nf6, 2...Nc6, 2...c5. If white's second move is 2 Bc4, black can respond with 2...Nf6, 2...Bc5 and 2...c6 (with a view to an early ...d5)}
Nc6 {Black saves his e-pawn and develops a piece, defending the e5 pawn and attacking d4.}
3.
Bc4 {The bishop attacks the diagonal leading towards the pawn that is only defended by blacks king. It does not mean that the bishop will necessarily capture this pawn in the next few moves, but the threat is always there. Often a bishop is sacrificed for this pawn in order to bring the king into the open where the other pieces may attack him. }
Bc5 {Black follows suit, attacking the pawn at f2, protected by only the king. In the opening, the bishop is best placed for attack when it controls a diagonal passing through the center or when it pins a hostile knight and renders it immobile. Defensively, the bishop would do a fine job at e7, where it radiates power in several directions, making the intrusion by an enemy piece difficult. }
4.
c3 {Supporting the advance of the d-pawn with a view to controlling the center. White postpones castling as his king is no danger. }
Nf6 {Black develops a piece and attacks a pawn.}
5.
d4 {White meets this by attacking a piece. }
exd4 {Practically forced, since Bd6 guarding the e-pawn is clumsy, since it blocks the d-pawn, while 5...Bb6 permits 6dxe5 Nxe4 7 Bxf7+ Kxf7 8 Qd5+ and white regains his piece, remaining a pawn ahead. White could also play 7 Qd5, attacking the knight white threatening mate, instead of 7 Bxf7+.}
6.
cxd4 {White's array of pawns looks impressive, but can the center be maintained?}
Bb4+ {Superior to Bb6, where 7 d5 Nb8 8e5 Ng8 9 O-O Ne7 10 d6 Ng6 11 Ng5 O-O (Black's king is protected by three pawns and the knight; in four moves the knight and one pawn disappear, while the remaining two pawns are pinned and helpless) 12 Qh5 (threatening 13 Qxh7#) 12...h6 13 Qxg6 (again threatening mate) 13...hxg5 14 Bxg5 Qe8 15 Bf6 and white, exploiting two pins, forces mate within two moves. After the text move, white must get his king out of check, and if possible save the threatened pawn. )}
7. Nc3 {White prefers this, which offers a pawn, to 7 Bd2 Bxd2+ 8 Nbxd2, when the e-pawn is protected.}
O-O {In this case, inappropriate, as white's center is formidable and must be destroyed. Black must play 7...Nxe4, accepting the offer of a pawn, and take his chances of surviving whatever attack may follow. It cannot be worse than passive castling, which results in both his knights being evicted from their fine posts. }
8.
d5 {Ordinarily such moves are suspect, as d5 should be occupied by a piece, but here the pawn dislodges the knight and prevents black forever from freeing his game by ...d5.}
Ne7 {As good as there is. The shift to a5 is countered by 9 Bd3, and the knight is stranded at the side of the board. }
9.
e5 {Now a shot at the other knight.}
Ne4 {Retreating to e8 does not look attractive, so black plays to exchange knights. }
10.
Qc2 {Protects his own knight, which was twice attacked, and threaten's the enemy's.}
Nxc3 {Practically forced, as defending the knight by 10...f5 allows 11 d6+ and the other knight falls.}
11.
bxc3 {This recapture gains a tempo: Black's bishop move lost a move retreating, white white's advantages multiply. Now he enjoys an open b-file for his rook and an extra diagonal for his dark-squared bishop. }
Bc5 {Offers better chances than moving to a5, the only other flight square. Whites position is superior. He has more pieces in play, and they have more mobility than black's. He also has better prospects for bringing more pieces into the battle. The recommended approach is to occupy black with threats - keep him on the run and allow him no time to put up effective resistance. }
12.
Ng5 {Ostensibly to scare black by force of mate; actually, the purpose is to induce a weakening advance of one of the king's retunue of pawns. If one of these pawns does move, black is done for. If 12...f5 13 d6+ winds a piece. If 12...g6, then 13 Ne4 forces 13...Bb6, when 14 Bh6 drives the rook to e8, and 15 Nf6+ wins the exchange. }
Ng6 {The only defense. The kingside pawns remain intact, but black has been compelled to place his pieces where white wants them. Under such circumstances the chances of black putting up a good fight are not too bright. White must avoid black's error of castling as a matter of routine development. Such a quiet course would give black time to play 13...d6 or 13...h6, beating the knight back. White must not give his opponent a moment to catch his breath. He must attack. }
13.
h4 {Threatening to move on h5, dislodging the knight, and then mate with the queen.}
h6 {Where else is there? Black tries to drive off the menacing knight. He cannot do this by 13...f6 as 14 d6+ Kh8 15 Nf7+ wins the exchange. }
14.
d6 {A powerful stroke. Black's bishop is cut off from the defense, while a line is opened for white's bishop. White now threatens Qxg6, as the pinned f-pawn could not capture the queen.}
hxg5 {Black might as well take whatever material he can. }
15.
hxg5 {The knight will not run away (the penalty being Qh7#) Meanwhile, the rook has a lovely open file, and the queen still threatens to capture the knight. }
Re8 {The king needs more room}
16.
Qxg6 {Regaining the piede without relaxing the pressure. White threatens one mate in one, and two mates in two. }
Rxe5+ {Black consoles himself by equalizing the material and gives one dispairing check before he yields. }
17.
Kf1 {Simplest, as the mate threats are still on tap. There was little chance that white would blunder by 17 Kd2 Qxg5+ 18 Qxg5 Rxg5, when all the good work has gone for naught. Black can avoid mate on the move by 17...e8 (incidentally threatening mate himself), only to fall into 18 Qh7+ Kf8 19 Qh8#} 1-0
